# VIRMISCO- The Virtual Microscope Slide Collection
 
**Project descrition:** The Virtual Microscope Slide Collection – VIRMISCO project has developed recommendations for taking microscopic image stacks of three-dimensional objects, depositing and presenting such series of digital image files or z-stacks as an online platform. The core of VIRMISCO is an online viewer, which enables the user to virtually focus through an object online as if using a real microscope. Additionally, VIRMISCO offers features such as search, rotating, zooming, measuring, changing brightness or contrast, taking snapshots, leaving feedback as well as downloading complete z-stacks as jpeg files or video file. The open source system can be installed by any institution and can be linked to a common database. 

**Project title:** Development of standards for the photographic documentation of permanent microscope slide mounts in precarious mounting media. The photographs are available on the internet platform “VIRMISCO – The Virtual Microscope Slide Collection”. 

**Funding:** The project was funded by the DFG (XY 12/6-1) from May 2014 to December 2017.

**Personnel:** The project was conducted at the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History under the supervision of Willi Xylander and Axel Christian. Eberhard Wurst (2014-2016) and Peter Decker (2016-2017) were involved as project managers. Diana Goernert (2014-2017) and Kerstin Franke (2014-present) provided technical assistance.

**Design and Software:** SednaSoft A. Schaffhirt and A. Wünsche GbR, Biesnitzer Straße 8, 02826 Görlitz, Germany and Senckenberg Museum of Natural History Görlitz.
